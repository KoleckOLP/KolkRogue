# KolkRogue
A rogue like engine I tried to make in 2019

My main goal was to load a txt file map into array of arrays<br>
find where the player @ is and let him walkaround<br>
but in the end walking around was way too slow<br>
so I wrote that the game wont reaload the whole map<br>
but use cursor and only replace the chars graphically but check the colisions in the real array<br>
this was all pre .NET CORE 3.0<br>
after .NET CORE 3.0 even reloading the whole map is already fast enough<br>

This has never turned out to be a whole game, or usable engine

if I want to ever continue this I'll rewrite it in python 3

lvl1.txt - made by me<br>
lvl2.txt - made by my sister<br>
lvl3.txt - made by my friend but I don't remember who<br>

[x] need to improve Program.cs of Launcher

[x] should use enum for tiles in Gneo

[x] visibility in Gneo map 100x100 visibility 11x11 for example

[x] Gneo also loads 2 files, map (txt) and sceneario (json)

[x] map only has walls and floor

[x] scenearios had player position, item positions, quests inverntory and everything else possibly
	quests, inventory, items are not implemented yet

[ ] also could be a template which gets copied to make active game and the game would save into the sceneario

[x] tile that doesn't have a '.' is a hole in the floor and should kill you?

[ ] would be cool to eventually list version of all 3 games somewhere.

30.03.25:
	[x] traps could be invisible
	[ ] and traps could have a chance to hurt, not hurt always

18.04.25:
	[x] q doesn't quit in Gneo

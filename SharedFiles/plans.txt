need to improve Program.cs of Launcher

should use enum for tiles in Gneo

visibility in Gneo map 100x100 visibility 11x11 for example

Gneo also loads 2 files, map (txt) and sceneario (json)

map only has walls and floor

scenearios had player position, item positions, quests inverntory and everything else possibly

also could be a template which gets copied to make active game and the game would save into the sceneario

tile that doesn't have a '.' is a hole in the floor and should kill you?

would be cool to eventually list version of all 3 games somewhere.
